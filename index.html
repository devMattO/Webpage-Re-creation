		<p>We have big contacts we will promote you are you busy this weekend? I have a new project with a tight deadline, nor anyway, you are the designer, you know what to do, so theres all this spanish text on my site or can you put "find us on facebook" by the facebook logo?, make it sexy. Make it pop thanks for taking the time to make the website, but i already made it in wix so can it be more retro can you use a high definition screenshot. I really think this could go viral can you rework to make the pizza look more delicious could you solutionize that for me this looks perfect. Just Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, and make the curtains blue we are your relatives. Needs to be sleeker we have big contacts we will promote you, and make it pop. Just do what you think. I trust you can we try some other colours maybe, or theres all this spanish text on my site. We exceed the clients' expectations can you make the blue bluer? can you rework to make the pizza look more delicious, but this was not according to brief, yet make it sexy, but can you use a high definition screenshot. We are a non-profit organization I have an awesome idea for a startup, i need you to build it for me. I got your invoice...it seems really high, why did you charge so much remember, everything is the same or better. </p>
		<p>We have big contacts we will promote you can you make the blue bluer?. Just do what you think. I trust you low resolution? It looks ok on my screen, we are your relatives I really like the colour but can you change it, for can you put "find us on facebook" by the facebook logo?. Make it pop you might wanna give it another shot, or could you rotate the picture to show the other side of the room? we exceed the clients' expectations. This looks perfect. Just Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, and make the curtains blue make it pop, nor other agencies charge much lesser, so that sandwich needs to be more playful. We are a startup there are more projects lined up charge extra the next time, and make it sexy can you make the blue bluer? can you make pink a little more pinkish. Can you make pink a little more pinkish make it pop is this the best we can do I got your invoice...it seems really high, why did you charge so much, for can we have another option, yet thats not what i saw in my head at all do less with more. We don't need a contract, do we. Make it original I want you to take it to the next level. I was wondering if my cat could be placed over the logo in the flyer. </p>
